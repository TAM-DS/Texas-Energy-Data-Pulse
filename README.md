🎯 About This Series

**What began as a Texas Energy dashboard series has evolved into a global intelligence project — exploring how compute power, energy efficiency, and agentic AI are redefining modern infrastructure.**

**Each dashboard in this repository visualizes a different dimension of transformation: from megawatts to teraflops, from on-prem to orbit, from human oversight to autonomous systems.**

**🧩 Each dashboard is interconnected — collectively mapping how energy, compute, and intelligence form the backbone of the modern economy.**
